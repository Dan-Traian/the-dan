      <p class=" text-base mac:text-2xl light mt-5">
        Web animations have been a constant focus for me, which I always try to grow as much as possible. In my spare
        time, I fiddle around aplenty with GSAP new features (v.3 is ðŸ”¥). Tweening, timelines, SVG animations have never
        been easier than now.
      </p>
      <p class=" text-base mac:text-2xl mt-5">
        A short list of plugins and libraries I use for the animations I develop : <br />
        <b>Create JS</b> ( ease, tween, sound and load ), <br /><b>AnimeJs</b> for its easings <br /><b>ScrollMagic</b>
        for , well, scroll magic events and animations <br />
        and ofc, <b>native Js</b> animations with CSS classes and listeners
      </p>
      <p class=" text-base mac:text-2xl light mt-5">
        My eyes sparkle whenever I get a good idea for a single page, story telling, scrolling experience.

        Vue and ThreeJs
      </p>
      <p class=" text-base mac:text-2xl light mt-5">
        With my dive into Vue, I'm slowly getting better and better at combining all of the above with the advantages of
        Vue and its animation and transition system. Components are a huge help separating behaviours.

        Very recent I have started diving into ThreeJS as well ðŸŒŸ
